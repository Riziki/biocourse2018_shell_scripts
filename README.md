### Scripts from the Bioinformatics Course 2018

[greet.sh](greet.sh) and [fancygreet.sh](fancygreet.sh) show off use
of `if` statements and `for` loops.

[runstats.sh](greet.sh) runs the `goostats` script from 
the `north-pacific-gyre` dataset to show the use for a `for` loop. 
This script needs to be in the same directory as `goostats`.

[params.sh](greet.sh) just shows the use of the `$#` special variable that
counts the number of parameters on a command line.

For all of the scripts run with `bash` e.g.
    bash params.sh
